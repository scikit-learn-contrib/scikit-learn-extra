scikit-learn-extra documentation
================================

scikit-learn-extra is a Python module for machine learning that extends scikit-learn. It includes algorithms that are useful but do not satisfy the scikit-learn `inclusion criteria <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/faq.html#what-are-the-inclusion-criteria-for-new-algorithms>`_, for instance due to their novelty or lower citation number.
